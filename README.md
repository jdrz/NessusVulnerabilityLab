<h1>JWipe - Nessus Vulnerability Managemet Lab Tutorial</h1>

  [1. Download Windows 10 ISO ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this tutorial I will be covering how to install and configure a Nessus Vulnerability Management Lab. I will be walking through the vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation which are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will then use Nessus Esentials to scan local VM's hosted on VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities and perform remediation.
